# ServerGroup
Created a class called ServerGroup to serve people waiting in line. It includes a dynamic integer array, a special-purpose server variable, and functions to check server availability, use a server, decrement time, and print values. Additionally, a destructor, an overloaded assignment operator, and a copy constructor for proper memory management and object assignment.
